# ESP-r_syntax
Syntax highlighter for ESP-r model data files for Sublime Text 3.

Please note, this is my own personal work and is not in any way supported by ESP-r or Sublime Text 3.

For a default sublime text 3 installation on a Linux system, place the file in ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User.
On a Windows system, the default location is C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User.

If correctly installed, will automatically apply to files with extensions .cfg, .cnn, .ctl, .afn, .geo, .con, .opr, .tmc, .dfd.
This can be modified by adding entries to the list "file_extensions".
Can also be manually selected for other files through the View -> Syntax menu.
